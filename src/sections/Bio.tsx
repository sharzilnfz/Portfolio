              I am <span className="font-extrabold">Sharzil</span> ðŸ‘‹, Currently
              I'm a Web Developer working with{' '}
              <span className="font-extrabold">React</span>,{' '}
              <span className="font-extrabold">Tailwind</span>,{' '}
              <span className="font-extrabold">Next.js</span>, and{' '}
              <span className="font-extrabold">TypeScript</span>. Yeah, it keeps
              me pretty busy building cool websites and apps. I spend most of my
              time figuring out new frameworks and getting better at coding.

            <p className=" text-black mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
              I've always been obsessed with computers and tech stuff since I
              was a kid. Love checking out how gadgets work and what's new in
              the tech world. The crazy speed of new innovations just never gets
              old for me.
            </p>
            <p className=" text-black mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
              So before I got into coding, I did graphic design for about two
              years. That whole experience taught me a lot about making things
              look good and user-friendly. When I started my CS undergrad at
              BRAC University, I thought "why not try building things with
              programming?"
            </p>
            <p className=" text-black mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">
              Switching from design to coding wasn't too crazy since both need
              problem-solving skills. My design background actually helps me
              build better interfaces and understand what people like. Now I mix
              visual stuff with coding to create complete web projects.
